# netneurotools
This toolbox is a collection of functions written in Python and Matlab that get frequent usage in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](www.misiclab.com), housed in the [Brain Imaging Centre](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/).

## Requirements

### Python

The Python tools require Python >= 3.5.

### Matlab

Matlab tools should work on R2012B or later (though that is an estimate based on the versions of Matlab that were around when the code was written).

## Installation

### Python

You can use `python setup.py install` to install the Python tools on your system. Access the tools via `import netneurotools`.

### Matlab
Simply add the `netneurotools_matlab` directory to your Matlab path in order to access those functions.

## Bugs and Questions

If you find any bugs, let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools/issues) and one of the lab members will try and help you to the best of their ability. 
Better yet, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools/pulls)!

There isn't any official documentation for now, but most of the functions have some information in the docstrings. 
If you can't figure something out, create an issue and we will do what we can!

## License

All tools are released under the BSD-3 license; the full details of the license can be found in the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file.
