Development
-----------

These tools have been developed by the members of the Network Neuroscience Lab
in pursuit of their research. While we've made every effort to ensure these
tools work and have some documentation, there is always room for improvement!
If you've found a bug, are experiencing a problem, or have a question, create a
new `issue <https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools/issues>`_ with some
information about it and one of our team members will do our best to help you.
