    Calculates group-level, thresholded functional connectivity matrix

    This function concatenates all time series in `data` and computes a group
    correlation matrix based on this extended time series. It then generates
    length `T` bootstrapped samples from the concatenated matrix and estimates
    confidence intervals for all correlations. Correlations whose sign is
    consistent across bootstraps are retained; inconsistent correlations are
    set to zero.

    If `n_boot` is set to 0 or None a simple, group-averaged functional
    connectivity matrix is estimated, instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : (N, T, S) array_like
        Pre-processed functional time series, where `N` is the number of nodes,
        `T` is the number of volumes in the time series, and `S` is the number
        of subjects
    n_boot : int, optional
        Number of bootstraps for which to generate correlation. Default: 1000
    ci : (0, 100) float, optional
        Confidence interval for which to assess the reliability of correlations
        with bootstraps. Default: 95
    seed : int, optional
        Random seed. Default: None

    Returns
    -------
    consensus : (N, N) numpy.ndarray

def struct_consensus(data, distance, hemiid):
    """
    Calculates group-averaged structural connectivity matrix

    Takes as input a weighted stack of connectivity matrices with dimensions
    (N, N, S) where `N` is the number of nodes and `S` is the number of
    matrices or subjects. The matrices must be weighted, and ideally with
    continuous weights (e.g. fractional anisotropy rather than streamline
    count). The second input is a pairwise distance matrix, where distance(i,j)
    is the Euclidean distance between nodes i and j. The final input is an
    (N, 1) vector which labels nodes as belonging to the right (`hemiid==0`) or
    left (`hemiid=1`) hemisphere (note that these values can be flipped as long
    as `hemiid` contains only values of 0 and 1).

    This function estimates the average edge length distribution and builds
    a group-averaged connectivity matrix that approximates this distribution
    with density equal to the mean density across subjects.

    The algorithm works as follows:

    1. Estimate the cumulative edge length distribution,
    2. Divide the distribution into M length bins, one for each edge that will
       be added to the group-average matrix, and
    3. Within each bin, select the edge that is most consistently expressed
       expressed across subjects, breaking ties according to average edge
       weight (which is why the input matrix `data` must be weighted).

    The algorithm works separately on within/between hemisphere links.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : (N, N, S) array_like
        Weighted connectivity matrices (i.e., fractional anisotropy), where `N`
        is nodes and `S` is subjects
    distance : (N, N) array_like
        Array where `distance[i, j]` is the Euclidean distance between nodes
        `i` and `j`
    hemiid : (N, 1) array_like
        Hemisphere designation for `N` nodes where a value of 0/1 indicates
        node `N_{i}` is in the right/left hemisphere, respectively

    Returns
    -------
    consensus : (N, N) numpy.ndarray
        Binary, group-level connectivity matrix
